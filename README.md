## Overview

This repository contains the **Saint-Venant Torsion Module**, developed for the **FlightBEND Finite Element Framework**, a Python-based environment for numerical simulation in solid and structural mechanics, which is an ongoing development project.

The name **FlightBEND** is a tribute to Bernoulli, Euler, Saint-Venant, and Santos Dumont. The project was originally conceived as a computational platform for the numerical analysis of aerospace structures. Over time, it has evolved into a general-purpose finite element framework designed for research, education, and engineering applications.

This project has been carried out at the Numerical Analysis Laboratory (LANum) of the [Federal University of Santa Maria - UFSM](https://www.ufsm.br/), involving graduate students from the [Mechanical Engineering Program - PGMec](https://www.ufsm.br/cursos/pos-graduacao/santa-maria/pgmec) and faculty members from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics.

## Features

- Implements the **classical Saint-Venant torsion theory**.  
- Computes **shear stress distribution**, **torsional stiffness**, and **warping functions**.  
- Fully written in **Python**, using an **object-oriented and modular design**.  
- Integrates with FlightBENDâ€™s components for **mesh generation**, **boundary conditions**, and **post-processing**.  
- Supports **structured and unstructured meshes**.  
- Ready for extension to **nonlinear torsion**, **coupled problems**, and **aeroelastic analyses**.

## Implementation Notes

The finite element formulation adopted in this module follows the standard weak form of Saint-Venantâ€™s torsion problem.  
The resulting linear system is assembled using FlightBENDâ€™s internal FEM infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with other FlightBEND modules.

## Requirements

- Python â‰¥ 3.10  
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  

## Usage

See the [multicell profile example](https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection/blob/main/notebooks/multicell_profile_example.ipynb).

Or

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection.git
cd fb.beamSection


# Example: open the multicell profile example using jupyter
jupyter-notebook notebooks/multicell_profile_example.ipynb
```

Other examples of usage can be found in [fb.beamSection/examples](https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection/tree/main/examples). The figure below is from the [wing_torsion_box.ipynb](https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection/blob/main/examples/5_wing_torsion_box/wing_torsion_box.ipynb) example.

## Verification

The `.inp` files for the ABAQUS 3D exemples from the paper may be found at the [verification_files](https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection/blob/main/verification_files) folder in a compacted `.7z` format.

## Mesh generation

For all examples we used the mesh generation from the [GiD](https://www.gidsimulation.com/) pre-processing software. If you wish to create `.py` files like the ones from our examples you'll also need to install the [MATFem](https://www.gidsimulation.com/downloads/educational-finite-element-codes-matfem/) plugin and download our customized [.bas](https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection/blob/main/mesh_files) file. The plugin allows for element material assigment and the `.bas` file exports the mesh as a python dictionary saved in the variable `mesh_data` containing the keys `'materials'`, `'coordinates'` and `'elements'`.  Check our tutorial on how to use GiD for this application on the [notebooks folder](https://github.com/tiagoburiol/fb.beamSection/tree/main/notebooks).
